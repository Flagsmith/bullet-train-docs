# Change Requests

## Overview

You can use Change Requests to add workflow control to the changing of Flag values. Change Requests allow a user to
propose a change to a flag value, and then require that change is approved by a number of other team members.

You can use Change Requests to ensure that, for example, a change to a flag in Production has to be approved by another
team member. They work in a similar way to Pull Requests in git.
