## Paid Hosting

If you would rather skip the hosting and jump straight to integrating Flagsmith with your own application, you can use
[https://flagsmith.com/](https://flagsmith.com/) right now. We have
[paid plans with pricing to suit both startups and enterprise customers alike](https://flagsmith.com/pricing).

## Self Hosting Overview

You will need to run through the following steps to get set up:

1. Create a Postgres database to store the Flagsmith data.
2. Deploy the API and set up DNS for it.
3. Deploy the Front End Dashboard and set up DNS for it. Point the Dashboard to the API using the relevant Environment
   Variables.
4. Create a new Organisation, Project, Environment and Flags via the Dashboard.
5. When using our SDKs, you will need to override the API URL that they point to, otherwise they will default to connect
   to our paid-for API at `https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1`. See the SDK documentation for the library you are using.

## Deployment Options

We recommend running Flagsmith with [Docker](/deployment/docker). We have options to run within
[Docker](/deployment/docker), [Kubernetes](/deployment/kubernetes) or [RedHat OpenShift](/deployment/openshift).

## Architecture

The Flagsmith architecture is based around a simple REST API that is accessed by both SDK clients and the Flagsmith
Dashboard Front End Web App.

![Application Architecture](/img/architecture.svg)

## Dependencies

Running the API has the following hard dependencies:

- Postgres database(We have tested it for 11.12 but it can work for other versions too) - the main data store

The API can also optionally make use of the following 3rd party services:

- Google Analytics - for API analytics
- InfluxDB - for API analytics
- SendGrid - for transactional email
- AWS S3 - to store Django Static Assets
- GitHub - oAuth provider
- Google - oAuth provider

## InfluxDB

Flagsmith has a soft dependency on InfluxDB to store time-series data. You don't need to configure Influx to run the
platform, but SDK traffic and flag analytics will not work without it being set up and configured correctly. Once your
docker-compose is running:

1. Create a user account in influxdb. You can visit http://localhost:8086/ and do this. Create an Initial Bucket with
   the name `flagsmith_api`
2. Go into Data > Buckets and create a second bucket, `flagsmith_api_downsampled_15m`.
3. Go into Data > Tokens and grab your access token.
4. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the following `environment` variables in the api service to connect the
   api to InfluxDB:
   - `INFLUXDB_TOKEN`: The token from the step above
   - `INFLUXDB_URL`: `http://influxdb`
   - `INFLUXDB_ORG`: The organisation ID - you can find it
     [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/organizations/view-orgs/)
   - `INFLUXDB_BUCKET`: `flagsmith_api`
5. Restart `docker-compose`
6. Log into InfluxDB, create a new bucket called `flagsmith_api_downsampled_15m`
7. Create a new task with the following query. This will downsample your per millisecond data down to 15 minute blocks
   for faster queries. Set it to run every 15 minutes.

```text
option task = {name: "Downsample", every: 15m}

data = from(bucket: "flagsmith_api")
	|> range(start: -duration(v: int(v: task.every) * 2))
	|> filter(fn: (r) =>
		(r._measurement == "api_call"))

data
	|> aggregateWindow(fn: sum, every: 15m)
	|> filter(fn: (r) =>
		(exists r._value))
	|> to(bucket: "flagsmith_api_downsampled_15m")
```

Once this task has run you will see data coming into the Organisation API Usage area.

## API Telemetry

Flagsmith collects information about self hosted installations. This helps us understand how the platform is being used.
This data is _never_ shared outside of the organisation, and is anonymous by design. You can opt out of sending this
telemetry on startup by setting the `TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable to any value.

We collect the following data on startup and then once every 8 hours per API server instance:

- Total number of Organisations
- Total number of Projects
- Total number of Environments
- Total number of Features
- Total number of Segments
- Total number of Users
- DEBUG django variable
- ENV django variable
- API server external IP address

## Running Flagsmith on Flagsmith

Flagsmith uses Flagsmith to control features on the front end dashboard. If you are self hosting the platform, you will
sometimes see features greyed out, or you may want to disable specific features, e.g. logging in via Google and Github.
If you are using your own Flagsmith environment then you will need to have a replica of our flags in order to control
access to those features.

To do this,firstly create a new project within your self-hosted Flagsmith application. This is the project that we will
use to control the features of the self-hosted Flagsmith instance. We will then point the self hosted front end
dashboard at this Flagsmith project in order to control what features show for your self hosted Flagsmith instance.

Once you have created the project, you need to set the following
[Front End](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith-frontend) environment variables in order to configure this:

- `FLAGSMITH`
  - The flagsmith environment key we use to manage features - Flagsmith runs on Flagsmith. This will be the API key for
    the project you created as instructed above.
- `FLAGSMITH_CLIENT_API`
  - The API URL which the Flagsmith front end dashboard should communicate with. This will most likely be the domain
    name of the Flagsmith API you are self hosting: Flagsmith runs on Flagsmith. E.g. For our SaaS hosted platform, the
    variable is `https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/`. For example, if you were running everything locally using the
    standard [docker-compose setup](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith-docker), you would use
    `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/`

Once you have set this up, you should see the Flagsmith front end requesting its own flags from the API (you can look in
your browser developer console to see this). You can now start creating flags and overriding the default behaviours of
the platform. For example, if you wanted to disable Google OAuth authentication, you would create a flag called
`oauth_google` and disable it.

### Current Flagsmith Feature Flags

The list of the flags and remote config we're currently using in production is below:

 }
]
```

We also have a Segment that manages the ui Dark Mode:

Segment Name: `dark_mode` Segment Rules: Trait `dark_mode` EXACTLY MATCHES `True`

Then use this rule to override the `dark_mode` Feature Flag.

## Manual Installation

If you want a more configurable environment, you can manually install both the Front End and the API.

### Server Side API

The source code and installation instructions can be found at
[the GitHub project](https://github.com/flagsmith/Bullet-Train-API). The API is written in Python and is based on Django
and the Django Rest Framework. The Server side API relies on a Postgres SQL installation to store its data, and a Redis
installation as a cache.

### Front End Website

The source code and installation instructions can be found at
[the GitHub project](https://github.com/flagsmith/Bullet-Train-Frontend). The Front End Website is written in
React/Javascript and requires NodeJS.
